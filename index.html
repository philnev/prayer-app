      <h3>Matthew 18-20 (The Message)</h3>
      <p>This week’s passage from Matthew 18-20 in The Message translation reveals the heart of the gospel story: teaching on discipleship.</p>
      <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> Teaching on discipleship invites us to consider how Jesus' actions and words shaped the lives of those around him. His presence disrupts, heals, and reveals. When we engage with these scriptures, we’re not just reading history, we’re allowing our own lives to be questioned and formed.</p>
      <p><em>How does this week's reading—teaching on discipleship—challenge or comfort you in your current season of life?</em></p>
