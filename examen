<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-900 mb-4">What is the Examen?</h2>
<p class="text-blue-900 mt-4">
  St Ignatius of Loyola, a 16th-century soldier-turned-mystic and the founder of the Jesuits, developed the Examen as a practical tool for spiritual attentiveness. He encouraged his companions to pray it twice daily — once at midday and once in the evening — to help them recognise God's presence in their lives and respond with love. Unlike lengthy formal prayers, the Examen was designed to be accessible, brief, and deeply personal. Its emphasis on noticing rather than performing has made it a treasured rhythm for seekers, sceptics, and saints alike.

<div class="tab-content bg-green-100 p-6 rounded-lg" id="how">
<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-900 mb-4">How Do I Pray It?</h2>
<p class="text-green-900 mb-2">The Examen is simple and flexible. Here’s a five-step version you can use:</p>
<ol class="list-decimal list-inside text-green-900 mb-6">
<li><strong>Pause and invite God in:</strong> Ask for light to see your day clearly and with grace.</li>
<li><strong>Give thanks:</strong> Recall moments of joy, comfort, or connection. Where did you feel alive?</li>
<li><strong>Review the day:</strong> Walk slowly through the day’s events. Notice your feelings and reactions.</li>
<li><strong>Face what’s hard:</strong> Acknowledge regrets, wounds, or missed chances. Let them be seen with mercy.</li>
<li><strong>Look ahead:</strong> Entrust tomorrow to God. Ask for the courage to live with love and awareness.</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-green-900 mb-2">An Examen Prayer</h3>
<p class="text-green-900 whitespace-pre-line">
<span class="bg-lime-200">Loving God, as I pause now, I welcome your light. Let me see this day not through my own distortion, but through your grace. Help me to settle, to breathe, to be here with you — fully, gently, honestly.</span> <em class="text-sm text-lime-800">(1. Pause and invite God in)</em>
<span class="bg-yellow-100">Thank you — for the warmth of the morning sun, the unexpected kindness, the laughter that lifted something in me. For the quiet moments of peace and the noisy ones where I remembered I was not alone. Thank you for what was simple, and for what was sacred in disguise.</span> <em class="text-sm text-yellow-600">(2. Give thanks)</em>
<span class="bg-sky-100">Now, Holy Spirit, walk with me through the day. Let me notice what I missed — the choices I made, the people I met, the burdens I carried. Where did I feel most alive? Most distant? Where was I hurried, or kind? Let me see what shaped me today, and who I was becoming.</span> <em class="text-sm text-sky-600">(3. Review the day)</em>
<span class="bg-red-100">God of mercy, I bring you what’s heavy: the words I regret, the chances I missed, the tiredness I ignored. Forgive me where I fell short — in love, in patience, in trust. Help me not to hide, but to come openhearted, knowing that you meet me here with compassion, not condemnation.</span> <em class="text-sm text-red-600">(4. Face what’s hard)</em>
<span class="bg-emerald-100">And now, as this day closes, I turn toward tomorrow. Shape my intentions in love. Plant courage where I feel fear, and peace where there’s unrest. Help me remember that every new day begins in grace — and that I walk into it with you, not alone.</span> <em class="text-sm text-emerald-600">(5. Look ahead)</em>
<strong class="text-green-900">Amen.</strong>

<div class="tab-content bg-orange-100 p-6 rounded-lg" id="why">
<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-orange-900 mb-4">Why Might It Help?</h2>
<p class="text-orange-900 mt-4">
  The Examen helps us catch glimpses of grace that might otherwise go unnoticed. A moment of clarity in a conversation, a tension released after naming our feelings, a sense of peace that surfaces in stillness — these become touchpoints of God's presence. By returning to these each day, we learn to trust that even in confusion or failure, God remains close.
</p>

<p class="text-orange-900 mt-4">
  Many who practise the Examen over time describe a subtle transformation — not just in how they pray, but in how they live. Decisions are made more thoughtfully. Gratitude flows more freely. And in life’s mess and mystery, they find a steadier sense of being accompanied.

<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-teal-900 mb-4">Adapting the Examen</h2>
  <p class="text-teal-900">
    The Examen is flexible. Whether you're a busy parent, a grieving heart, or a child learning to pray, this practice can meet you where you are.
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-teal-900 mt-4">
    <li><strong>Children:</strong> Use three simple prompts: “What made you smile today?” “What was hard?” “Where was God in that?”</li>
    <li><strong>Busy adults:</strong> Try a two-minute Examen: pause, name one gift from today, one regret, and one hope for tomorrow.</li>
    <li><strong>In grief:</strong> Ask gently, “What did I carry today? What comfort did I notice?”</li>
    <li><strong>For discernment:</strong> Ask, “When did I feel most alive? When did I feel least myself?” These patterns may guide your next step.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="text-teal-900 mt-4">
    The Examen doesn’t demand perfection — only honesty and presence. In each season, it becomes a gentle, grounding companion.

<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-900 mb-4">A Prayer in Words</h2>
  <p class="text-red-900 whitespace-pre-line">
    Loving God,

    I pause to breathe, and welcome your light.
    Let me see this day as you saw it — with compassion.

    Thank you for what was kind and good.
    For a task completed, a laugh shared,
    a quiet moment of connection.
    These were your gifts.

    Help me now to look back honestly.
    Where was I stretched?
    Where did I avoid love?
    Where did I show up fully?

    I name what was hard — and I offer it to you.
    I rest not in perfection, but in grace.

    And I look ahead.
    Help me carry forward what I’ve learned.
    Shape my heart for tomorrow.
    Make me ready to walk with you again.

    Amen.
