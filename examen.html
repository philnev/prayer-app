<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-900 mb-4">What is the Examen?</h2>
<p class="text-blue-900 mb-4">
    The Examen is a prayer of presence — a quiet, reflective way to end the day by noticing where God has been at work, even in the mess and the muddle. It helps us become more attentive, more grateful, more honest.
  </p>
  <p class="text-blue-900 mb-4">
    It was developed by St Ignatius of Loyola, a Spanish soldier-turned-priest who founded the Jesuit order in the 16th century. Ignatius had a deep conviction that God could be found in all things — not just in church, but in the clatter of daily life. For him, spiritual discipline wasn’t about escaping the world but waking up to it.
  </p>
  <p class="text-blue-900 mb-4">
    In his *Spiritual Exercises*, Ignatius encouraged every Jesuit to pray the Examen twice a day — not as a rigid duty, but as a rhythm for deepening their relationship with God. It was a way of training the heart to notice: What moved me today? What disturbed me? Where did love show up — and where did I turn away?
  </p>
  <p class="text-blue-900">
    The Examen isn't about performance or perfection. It’s about paying attention. It’s about letting God’s light fall gently on the story of your day, and discovering that even in your most ordinary moments, you are being shaped by grace.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="tab-content bg-green-100 p-6 rounded-lg" id="how">
<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-green-900 mb-4">How Do I Pray It?</h2>
<p class="text-green-900 mb-2">The Examen is simple and flexible. Here’s a five-step version you can use:</p>
<ol class="list-decimal list-inside text-green-900 mb-6">
<li><strong>Pause and invite God in:</strong> Ask for light to see your day clearly and with grace.</li>
<li><strong>Give thanks:</strong> Recall moments of joy, comfort, or connection. Where did you feel alive?</li>
<li><strong>Review the day:</strong> Walk slowly through the day’s events. Notice your feelings and reactions.</li>
<li><strong>Face what’s hard:</strong> Acknowledge regrets, wounds, or missed chances. Let them be seen with mercy.</li>
<li><strong>Look ahead:</strong> Entrust tomorrow to God. Ask for the courage to live with love and awareness.</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-green-900 mb-2">An Examen Prayer</h3>
<p class="text-green-900 whitespace-pre-line">
<span class="bg-lime-200">Loving God, as I pause now, I welcome your light. Let me see this day not through my own distortion, but through your grace. Help me to settle, to breathe, to be here with you — fully, gently, honestly.</span> <em class="text-sm text-lime-800">(1. Pause and invite God in)</em>
<span class="bg-yellow-100">Thank you — for the warmth of the morning sun, the unexpected kindness, the laughter that lifted something in me. For the quiet moments of peace and the noisy ones where I remembered I was not alone. Thank you for what was simple, and for what was sacred in disguise.</span> <em class="text-sm text-yellow-600">(2. Give thanks)</em>
<span class="bg-sky-100">Now, Holy Spirit, walk with me through the day. Let me notice what I missed — the choices I made, the people I met, the burdens I carried. Where did I feel most alive? Most distant? Where was I hurried, or kind? Let me see what shaped me today, and who I was becoming.</span> <em class="text-sm text-sky-600">(3. Review the day)</em>
<span class="bg-red-100">God of mercy, I bring you what’s heavy: the words I regret, the chances I missed, the tiredness I ignored. Forgive me where I fell short — in love, in patience, in trust. Help me not to hide, but to come openhearted, knowing that you meet me here with compassion, not condemnation.</span> <em class="text-sm text-red-600">(4. Face what’s hard)</em>
<span class="bg-emerald-100">And now, as this day closes, I turn toward tomorrow. Shape my intentions in love. Plant courage where I feel fear, and peace where there’s unrest. Help me remember that every new day begins in grace — and that I walk into it with you, not alone.</span> <em class="text-sm text-emerald-600">(5. Look ahead)</em>
<strong class="text-green-900">Amen.</strong>

<div class="tab-content bg-orange-100 p-6 rounded-lg" id="why">
<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-orange-900 mb-4">Why Might It Help?</h2>
<p class="text-orange-900 mb-4">
    The Examen helps us listen — not just to God, but to our own lives. So often, we move from one thing to the next without pausing to ask: Where was my heart stirred today? Where did I go numb? What was that knot in my chest about — or that warm moment I brushed past too quickly?
  </p>
  <p class="text-orange-900 mb-4">
    This simple daily prayer creates space for a kind of spiritual housekeeping. It clears the clutter, dusts off forgotten moments, and lets the light in. Over time, it trains us to live more awake — to spot grace in the middle of a difficult meeting, to feel God’s nudge in a chance conversation, to be gentler with ourselves when we mess up.
  </p>
  <p class="text-orange-900 mb-4">
    It’s especially helpful in times of change, fatigue, or decision. When life feels uncertain, the Examen anchors us in what is real and redeemable. It teaches us that no part of our day — however mundane or messy — is outside God’s reach.
  </p>
  <p class="text-orange-900">
    Most of all, the Examen opens a relationship. It’s not just a tool for self-reflection. It’s a way of meeting God in the real, unfiltered story of your life — not the life you wish you were living, but the one you are living now. And in that honest meeting, there is healing, growth, and grace.

<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-teal-900 mb-4">Adapting the Examen</h2>
<p class="text-teal-900 mb-4">
    The Examen isn’t one-size-fits-all. It was never meant to be. It’s a spiritual habit that can grow with you — through joy and heartbreak, clarity and confusion, long walks and sleepless nights. Whatever season you’re in, this prayer can meet you there.
  </p>
  <p class="text-teal-900 mb-4">
    For children, it might be as simple as two bedtime questions: “What made you happy today?” and “What made you sad?” For teenagers, it might mean journaling about where they felt most themselves. For adults walking through grief, it might begin with naming what felt heavy — and stopping there, if that’s enough for one day.
  </p>
  <p class="text-teal-900 mb-4">
    The Examen can also help with decision-making. When you're torn between two paths, look back over recent days: Which choice brings peace, even if it’s scary? Which one leaves you restless? God often speaks not in lightning bolts, but in patterns — in the quiet traces of joy and disquiet written across the days.
  </p>
  <p class="text-teal-900 mb-4">
    It can be a balm in burnout — when you don’t have big answers, but you can still whisper thanks for that one moment of kindness, or cry out about what felt too much. God is not waiting for you to be sorted. God is in the sorting.
  </p>
  <p class="text-teal-900">
    However you adapt it — spoken or silent, long or short, with words or with tears — let it be real. That’s the only rule. God can work with honesty. The Examen simply gives you a shape to begin with, and the permission to bring your day to God, just as it is.

<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-red-900 mb-4">A Prayer in Words</h2>
<p class="text-red-900 whitespace-pre-line">

    Loving God,

    As this day draws to a close, I take a breath.
    I step back from the noise, the lists, the screens, the shoulds.
    Let your stillness settle around me now — like a warm coat after the wind.

    Thank you.
    For what was good today — even if small.
    For the smile I didn’t expect, the task I managed, the moment I remembered who I am.
    Thank you for the flickers of joy I nearly missed — 
    and the deep-down things that carry me even when I forget they’re there.

    Now, with you beside me, I walk through the day again.
    Where did I feel most alive? 
    What made me withdraw?
    When did I love well? 
    And where did I close off or rush past?

    Show me, Holy Spirit — not with harshness, but with truth wrapped in kindness.
    Help me notice not just what I did, but how I felt.
    What tugged at me? What lifted me? What drained me?
    Who did I listen to? Who did I overlook?

    And now I bring to you what aches:
    The words I wish I hadn’t said.
    The things I avoided.
    The tiredness I pushed through instead of tending.
    I don’t bring them to be scolded. I bring them to be healed.
    Meet me here with mercy.

    And as I look to tomorrow —
    I don’t know what it holds.
    But I offer myself to it anyway.
    Shape my intentions. Root me again in grace.
    Let me walk more gently, speak more kindly, love more freely.
    Remind me that I never do it alone.

    In your hands, and with your Spirit, I rest.

    Amen.
